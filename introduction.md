# Introduction

Welcome to Ronin :)

As you all know, Ronin is Makers Academy's newest project to try and repeat our in-person results with remote students. You have all been carefully selected to be a part of this beta-test based on your qualifications and our assessment of your willingness to put in the required work.

This course will be intensive.

Over the next 16 weeks you'll be challenged, frustrated, sad, happy, excited, surprised and....tired. Get prepared now. Take time to eat well, exercise and generally take care of yourself.

For the course you'll be using many of the materials that we've developed for our in-person course. Because of this, you'll see many references to our office, raising your hand, calling over coaches, a "12 week course" instead of 16 weeks, etc. which will NOT apply to you. Just ignore it and don't be afraid to ask for clarification.

Makers Academy is a lean startup and we are constantly rapidly testing things that we think will make it easier for people to learn how to code. Revamping months of content is not a lean way to do things so we didn't. You'll be seeing the exact same content as our in-person students.

With that caveat in mind, let's dive in.

Overview of the Makers Week
-------------------------

Over the next 16 weeks you're required to participate in Makers Academy work from 0900-1800 at a minimum. This means that you'll be available on our various communication platforms, consuming material or coding.

This is roughly how the 16 weeks breaks down (subject to change):

Week 1: Command Line
Week 2: Git
Week 3: RSpec
Week 4: Ruby
Week 5: Boris Bikes
Week 6: Battleships
Week 7: Battleships Web
Week 8: Bookmark Manager
Week 9: Javascript
Week 10: Lab Week
Week 11: Node
Week 12: Makerthon (Teams)
Week 13: Rails
Week 14: Project 1
Week 15: Project 2
Week 16: Employment Week

The breakdown above is NOT set in stone and is purely just a rough overview of what you'll be learning and in what order. We might end up working slightly ahead or behind the breakdown above - don't let that be a source of anxiety.

In terms of keeping track of learning objectives, this is how things will be broken down:

Every week has a lesson plan. Inside of that lesson plan you'll have three elements: (1) required learning materials, (2) optional learning materials and (3) the weekly test. The materials will be presented in that order and you should go through them in that order. It's required that you complete (1) the required learning materials and (3) the weekly test every week. The (2) optional learning materials are just that - optional. Different students will progress at different speeds and the optional materials are there for those students that happen to get through a specific lesson faster than his/her classmates.

Everything you need to know is included in the required materials and the weekly test - do NOT get stressed if you're not able to dive into the optional learning materials.

Daily Standups
--------------

Every day at 0930 and 1430 we'll have a daily standup via Google Hangouts. We'll keep these standups short to go over some baseline information about the day's lesson and to make sure everyone is moving along nicely.

What to do if you have a question...
-------------------------

Learning at Makers Academy is a very proactive process. We guide you to the water holes, but you have to drink. Learning to be a great developer is largely learning how to solve your own problems. Because of this, we use a regimented learning process from day 1. 

Whenever you have a question, this is the process you should follow to get your answer, only moving on when you've exhausted all previous steps:

Step 1 - Ask Google: Seriously try to find the answer through Google. The "serious" line will change based on the difficulty of the question and how exhausted you are. We trust that you'll find a good balance on your own for what this means exactly.

Step 2 - Ask Your Pairing Partner: You'll be pair-programming a lot. We'll go into exactly what this means later, but suffice it to say that you'll be writing a lot of code with somebody else. If you can't find the answer to your question / problem on Google in a reasonable amount of time, ask your pairing partner.

Step 3 - Ask Your Cohort: Your remote ronin cohort has a dedicated slack channel that will be used specifically for this. 

Step 4 - Ask StackOverflow: StackOverflow is a question-and-answer site used specifically for coding problems. You'll get to know it well. If you've exhausted steps 1-3, ask StackOverflow for help.

Step 5 - Ask a Facilitator: Facilitators are sort of like assistant coaches. They might be Makers Academy employees, more senior students, past students, etc.

Step 6 - Ask a Coach: Only after exhausting steps 1-5 can you ask a coach for help. This is for your own good as learning how to solve your own problems is the only way to becoming a great developer. Steps 1-5 are so important that you shouldn't be surprised if a coach asks to confirm that you've completed them before asking for their assistance.

Logistics
-------------------------

* MUST install slack desktop client
* MUST create StackOverflow & Github accounts
* MUST post or upvote on SO at least once a week
* MUST do 1-to-1s
* MUST show up (mentally & physically)
* MUST complete the "End of Day" survey every day

End of Day Survey
-------------------------

Things will get hectic and it may not always be clear to us at Makers Academy how we're doing or what we could be doing better. Because of this, we ask that you fill out a couple of short questions at the end of every day to let us know. Here is the link to the form:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1w7oOPWb99aYeWQTDWU47LBHIExXz-uXwT8jBKwVskiM/viewform

We recommend bookmarking the link above and making yourself a calendar or alarm reminder to fill it out every Monday through Friday. Nobody is going to stand over you and make you fill this out and yes, it's completely anonymous - it's just one way in which you can help us out in making the course better.


Mondays are 1-1 days!
-------------------------

You will spend much of the day in peer-driven 1-1’s, as well as spending ~45 minutes with a coach doing a topdown code review. Any free time on Mondays should be spent refactoring your code / challenge solution from the previous week, &or reading through the materials for the upcoming week.

Morning
The morning will be spent doing a 45 minute code review with a coach, as well as reading through your peers Github accounts in preparation for peer code reviews in the afternoon.

Afternoon
You will spend an hour with each of the other students in your cohort. In the first half of each session, you will spend 5-10 minutes talking through your code, after which your pair partner will dedicate ~20 minutes to reviewing your code, offering tips and ideas for refactoring and restructuring, and generally debating your design decisions with you. The roles will then be switched in the second half of the session, where they will spend 5-10 minutes talking through their own code from the past week, after which you will get the chance to review their work and offer feedback


The Agile Process
---------------

Ultimately we want all of you to be able to manage the whole web development stack, completely independently of us.

The Agile process is the heart of Makers Academy.  In contrast to the big design up front approach of give us £8M to build a system and we'll see you in two years, and it turns out that it doesn't work.

![Agile Process](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/agile.png)

This agile process is fundamental - it's about making sure that the process you are using to get towards your goal is being tuned to ensure that you are moving effectively towards your goal.

Three Tier Web Architecture
----------------

Here's a simple overview of the three tier web architecture that is the critical technical concept that you must have in your head to be a successful web developer.  It's all about a process of communication between a user's web browser and a server.  A server is just another computer, but it's often a computer with a dedicated internet connection and lots of resources.  It will also usually consist of a web server (to serve web pages), and application engine (to allow dynamic generation of those pages) and a database (to reliably store data related to those pages):

![Three Tier Simple](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/3-tier-simple.png)

If we drill down a little we can see the HTTP protocol that is the lingua franca of the web and is the communication mechanism that allows the web to exist across multiple computers.  We can also see that the application engine is where web developers have to handle a lot of the complexity.  That is not to say that databases and web servers can't become very complex.  In fact they are very complex, but often they are used by web developers out of the box, and it's the application engine that takes up the most time.  It's technologies relating to the application engine that will take up a good proportion of the time at Makers.


![Three Tier Middle](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/3-tier-middle.png)

Drilling down even further we can see the names of the many technologies, languages, frameworks and protocols that are used at the different levels in the three tier application stack, as well as examples of what some of these look like.  This diagram will largely seem like gobbledigook at the beginning of the course.  By the end of the course it will seem much clearer.  There will still be grey areas, but you will start to feel comfortable with knowledge of the different moving parts that allow you to create and problem shoot large web applications.

![Three Tier Detail](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/images/3-tier.png)

However note that there is far more complexity here than we can cover in 12 weeks.  Ultimately you will need to become a self-directed learner and drill down further in the areas that your agile process indicates you have greater need for knowledge.

This is the Rosetta Stone of web development.  We want you to be great programmers and great project managers, and great team members, but critically we are focused on helping you become web developers, so understanding this architecture is key.
