# Installation Instructions

We believe itâ€™s important to give you a chance to learn how to install everything you'll need as a web developer yourself.
Please google the name of the software to find where it should be installed from. In some cases (e.g. Ruby with openssl support) it maybe helpful to google for installation instructions as well.

## Essential tools

You will need these tools to complete the PreCourse. Take care to install them in the prescribed order.

1. Update the operating system to the latest version by installing all updates.
2. **[XCode command-line tools](installing_xcode.md)**&nbsp;:pill:&nbsp;(Necessary on Mac only).
3. **[RVM](installing_rvm.md)**&nbsp;:pill:&nbsp;It stands for Ruby Version Manager and it helps you to install and manage different Ruby versions.
4. **Ruby.** Please install the latest stable version using RVM, not directly. Pay special attention to install it with openssl support (this may be tricky, if you fail, we'll help you during the PreCourse).
5. **Heroku Toolbelt** (this includes Git). This is the set of tools that we'll be using for development and deployment.

## Useful tools you may like to have

1. **Homebrew.** This is a package manager that will be useful to install other software.
2. **Sublime Text.** We'll give you a license key to register it on your first day of classes.
3. **Google Chrome.** The best web browser when it comes to web development.

Good luck! Again - this is supposed to be hard! If it were easy, everyone would be doing it! If you give it an honest try and fail, we'll help you during the PreCourse.
