# The Command Line

Learning how to use the command line is an essential skill for any developer. You'll learn many things in the upcoming lessons that will be much easier to grasp if you understand how to use the command line.

Before you start on learning the command line please ensure that you have been set up with a [Mentor](mentoring.md).  If you get stuck on anything for more than 20 or 30 minutes, please do ask questions in the [issues section](https://github.com/makersacademy/pre_course/issues) of the pre-course, flagging your Mentor by pre-pending their Github username with a '@' symbol.  Don't have a mentor?  Contact [meta@makersacademy.com](mailto:meta@makersacademy.com)

So, let's start with learning the command line, also known as the terminal, because it's the essential tool all developers use to interact with the computer. If you think about when you learned math at school, you wouldn't be able to understand algebra if you didn't understand multiplication â€“ this is the same principle.

You're not required to know everything about the command line by the end of this lesson, it's merely meant as a brief introduction to give you a basic understanding and to show you where to look for future reference.
