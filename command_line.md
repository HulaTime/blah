# The Command Line

Learning how to use the command line is an essential skill for any developer. You'll learn many things in upcoming lessons that will be much easier to grasp once you understand how to use the command line.

We start with learning the command line, also known as the terminal, because it's the essential tool all developers use to interact with the computer. If you think about when you learned math at school, you wouldn't be able to understand algebra if you didn't understand multiplication â€“ this is the same principle.

You're not required to know everything about the command line by the end of this lesson, it's merely meant as a brief introduction to give you a basic understanding and to show you where to look for future reference.
