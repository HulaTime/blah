So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

Before you start at Makers Academy you should go through the following tutorials and pills to get yourself ready:

## Tutorials

It is essential that you work through these tutorials as they cover the bare essentials of the Ruby language.
