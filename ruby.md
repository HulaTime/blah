# Ruby

So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

Before you start at Makers Academy you should go through the following pills and tutorials to get yourself ready:

## Pills - Go through all 3 first

Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.

- :pill: [Strings](/pills/strings.md)
- :pill: [Arrays](/pills/arrays.md) 
- :pill: [Hashes](/pills/hashes.md) 

## Tutorials - Do at least one, at most all :)

It is essential that you work through at least one of these tutorials as they cover the bare essentials of the Ruby language. Each has it's own style - try spending 15-20 mins on each, pick one you enjoy, and FINISH IT!

### Exercises

Once you've finished one of the tutorials above, have a go at solving some of these exercises. While the tutorials are useful, you only really start learning to code when you actually write code. So get cracking!

### Zen Ruby (like being hit by Zen Master with bamboo stick)

A challenging and interesting Ruby tutorial, that also teaches you about error messages and TDD. It seems a little confusing at the start, but once you get going, it's a phenomenal resource. Many graduates name this as one of their favourite tutorials from their early days.
