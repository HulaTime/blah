So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

Before you start at Makers Academy you should go through the following tutorials and pills to get yourself ready:

## Tutorials

It is essential that you work through these tutorials as they cover the bare essentials of the Ruby language.

- [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org)
- [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
- [Ruby in 20 minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
- [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

## Pills

Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.
