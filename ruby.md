# Ruby

> Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro _"Matz"_ Matsumoto, blended parts of his favourite languages ( _Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp_ ) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

Before you start at Makers Academy you should go through the following pills and tutorials to get yourself ready:

## Tutorials

Task 1

Go through and complete Learn Ruby the Hardway :

- [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/intro.html)

Ensure the answers are posted up onto Github as you go through the challenge to cement your Git training from last week.

In addition to the above book, it's critical that you work through at least one of these tutorials as they cover the bare essentials of the Ruby language.

(We've put them in order for you - Ruby Monk being the best in our eyes, The Well Grounded Rubyist being, not the worst, but the hardest to finish...)

- [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/chapters/6-objects/lessons/35-introduction-to-objects)
- [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
- [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html)
- [The Well Grounded Rubyist](http://pingo.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist.pdf)

And here are some great videos you could watch if you want to kick back and put your feet up for a while...!

## Pills - Go through all 3 if you have time (They go over what you learnt in the previous tutorial)

Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.

### Wanna try something different? Do some Zen Ruby :)

A challenging and interesting Ruby tutorial, that also teaches you about error messages and TDD. It seems a little confusing at the start, but once you get going, it's a phenomenal resource. Many graduates name this as one of their favourite tutorials from their early days.
