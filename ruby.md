So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

The next two weeks you will be working hard to understand as much Ruby as possible. You should go through the following pills and tutorials to get yourself ready:

## Pills 

Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.

- :pill: [Arrays](/pills/arrays.md)
- :pill: [Hashes](/pills/hashes.md)

## Tutorials

Week 1 : 

You challenge will last the full week and you will be working on our iteration of Ruby Kickstart. You can find the repo here : https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby-kickstart. 

How to tackle the challenge :

1. Watch the videos! These are in the intro folder for each session of Ruby Kickstart and also here : [Ruby Kickstart Videos](https://vimeo.com/channels/844657)
2. Read *ALL* the documentation and do *ALL* the exercises (ie: you shouldn't clone the repo - it needs to be **forked**)
3. Complete Sessions 1 and 2 and place your answers in the challenges section of the repo and send a pull request to us when done. 

Below are some resources that we recommmend you use for the challenge:

### Wanna try something different? Do some Zen Ruby :)

A challenging and interesting Ruby tutorial, that also teaches you about error messages and TDD. It seems a little confusing at the start, but once you get going, it's a phenomenal resource. Many graduates name this as one of their favourite tutorials from their early days.
