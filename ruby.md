# Ruby

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro _"Matz"_ Matsumoto, blended parts of his favourite languages ( _Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp_ ) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

So Ruby is an all purpose programming language, in short a language that lets you program anything you can imagine ( _you can even create iPhone and iPad applications with Ruby!_ ). On top of that it is a beautiful and simple language that lets you write elegant code.

So you already know some Ruby because in preparation for your interview you completed [Chris Pine's Learn To Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) up to chapter 8 and the [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby).  

If it has been a long time since you read the Learn To Program book, or did the Codecademy Ruby Track then we recommend that you re-do them in order to ensure their contents are up to date in your mind.  And when we say do, in the case of the Learn To Program, **it is absolutely critical that you not only read, but type out every code example out yourself** and run them via the command line, or using the [interactive ruby interpreter (IRB))[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell].  You must actively type the code in order to learn at the most accelerated rate.

Now that you have completed your interview and started the precourse, and need to continue developing your Ruby skills, we recommend that you continue with [Chris Pine's Learn To Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/).  **Please complete chapters 9-14 before the end of week 3.** Please attempt every exercise, submitting the code to us using your newfound git and GitHub skils by forking [https://github.com/makersacademy/learn_to_program](https://github.com/makersacademy/learn_to_program), and submitting a pull request. Do not spend more than an hour on any individual exercise.  The solutions are included at the end of the book.  This week it is better that you cover all the chapters, and review the solutions for any exercises that you cannot complete in under an hour.  Please do not look at any individual solution until you have at least tried each individual exercise.

If you find that you really dislike the style of 'Learn To Program' then as an alternative please try [Ruby KickStart](http://www.ruby-kickstart.com/), which also includes videos and challenges which you can fork from [https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby-kickstart](https://github.com/makersacademy/ruby-kickstart).  We'll be happy to accept completion of all the challenges from section 1 and 2 of Ruby Kickstart, as an equivalent to doing the exercises from Learn To Program.

In week 4 we recommend that you try and cover as much of the [The Well Grounded Rubyist](http://pingo.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist.pdf) as possible, whilst also signing up for [Codewars](www.codewars.com/r/UiT03A).  Please see the following [ videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc4BYny7PXeRAnS-spcZWfzVcKg1PONXP) on how to work with codewars. Ideally by the time you start the main coureon Day 1 - you should be at least over 50 points on codewars using the 8kyu and 7kyu challenges.

The next two weeks you will be working hard to understand as much Ruby as possible.  Please refer to the [learning objectives](learning_objectives.md) for the base level you must achieve. You may also find the following pills and tutorials helpful to get yourself ready:

## Pills

Strings, Arrays and Hashes are the three data classes that you will be likely to use more than any other. These pills give a basic overview, but we recommend that you strive to learn every available method for all 3 classes.

### Wanna try something different? Do some Zen Ruby :)

A challenging and interesting Ruby tutorial, that also teaches you about error messages and TDD. It seems a little confusing at the start, but once you get going, it's a phenomenal resource. Many graduates name this as one of their favourite tutorials from their early days.
