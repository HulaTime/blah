Mentoring Program

Purpose of the Mentoring Program
--------------------------------

Aside from the obvious idea of just having someone to talk to, there are 3 main ways we think you should make the most of having a mentor from Makers Academy:

1) Advice

Your mentor was where you are only 6 weeks ago - so ask them for advice. Whether it's about what to do, how best to prepare, any tips on making the most of the pre-course, even good places to go for lunch around the office... They are an ocean of useful advice!

2) Technical issues

While it's not your mentors job to teach you, there may be technical issues that you have that they can help with, or if nothing else they will be able to advise you on how/where to go to find the answers to your problems. Wandering why your iterator is always returning nil? Ask! Can't decide on whether it's better to go deeper into Ruby or get started on the Command Line? Ask! Your mentors have been there and got the t-shirt, and it's amazing how much they've learnt in the past 6 weeks.

3) Pair partners

As we say to our students time and again - the best way to learn is to teach. We highly recommend trying to come into Makers for an hour or so a week to pair with your mentor on the pre-course materials or on writing some simple Ruby programmes. It will help your mentor to solidify what they've been learning and it will allow you to work with someone who is a little further on their coding journey. If evenings don't work (We're open til 8.30pm every day) then weekends might be an option, and if you aren't in London, google 'remote pairing' - there are programs like ScreenHero and CodeBox and many more that you could try out ;)
