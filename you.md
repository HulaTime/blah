# What are we looking for in you?

These are a few points that we look for in every student that has decided to be part of Makers Academy for the intense 12 week course.

## Culturally
- Enthusiasm for  solving challenges and learning!
- Willingness to check in, connect, and share your  feelings
- Curiosity (how things fit in together and work)
- Exposing your ignorance. Speak up if you donâ€™t know!
- You strike a good balance between listening and speaking
- Engage the coaches when you are stuck

## Technically
- Identify concepts that are confusing and ask for help
- Demonstrate your comfort with reading and writing code
- Use the technical skills you've learned in the challenges (or even in pet projects you might choose to do during the course).
- Transfer knowledge to other students in the course
