#### Dear Future Maker, ####

Major congratulations for making it onto the course. We're really looking forward to helping you find your feet as a developer. You're going to learn so much, make great friends, be constantly challenged, excited and enthused – you're going to turn your life upside down. Smart move.

We're writing to let you know what we expect from you during your three months at Makers Academy – and what you should expect from yourself. We will also share some thoughts on who we are, how we operate and what you can expect from us in return.

Please read this document carefully and sign at the bottom to acknowledge you understand what you’re embarking on and what frame of mind we'd like you to bring when you walk through our doors.

#### What is Makers Academy? ####
Makers Academy was founded to help people get to an employable level in software/web development. We’re not in education for the sake of education. We’re in education for the sake of getting people into well-paid junior developer jobs, and empowering people to build real-world projects.

We want to be the best and we work every day to improve the course, to ensure we stay ahead of the game. Sometimes we make mistakes – it's one of the ways we learn and get better. More often though, we succeed. And we’ve now succeeded in getting lots of people into (highly paid) junior developer jobs, following our tried and tested course. Employers constantly knock on our doors, begging to hire Makers graduates. (Okay, maybe they don't actually beg, but they are proper keen.)

#### Learning the Makers Academy way ####
Our course is unique, not just because of its intensity, but also because of our approach.
Your experience at Makers Academy will be vastly different from the 20-odd years you most likely spent in ‘traditional’ education: school, college or university. The first main difference is that we've chosen not to provide qualifications or accreditations.

#### Why? ####
We believe that traditional education – geared towards qualifications and accreditations –teaches people to pass exams, rather than learn. At Makers Academy we’re not going to give you grades. We not here to teach you: you’re here to learn. Call us pedantic, but there is a huge difference: you’re not going to regurgitate content we give you in order to ‘pass or fail’; we won't review your code like it's homework, red pen in hand, but we will be there to show you what you should be improving; and your peers and seniors will help you learn just as much as your instructors.

**You’re not going to be spoon-fed.**

We'll give you a structured day-by-day curriculum, projects, exercises and Friday challenges,but you’re expected to chase the knowledge and experiences yourself. As a junior, your seniors (just a few weeks ahead of you) will be standing up and teaching you; and when you're a senior, you'll be expected to teach your juniors in return. You’ll try, test, fail and keep on failing until you understand. You’ll adapt to the changes on the course, as technology changes rapidly and so too does our content and curriculum. You’ll be pro-active and ensure you ask for the help you need, as no one else but you knows your individual needs. You’ll pair-program, not only to learn a useful skill but as way to develop your ability to communicate about code, and to help your pair partner learn as well.

Rather than being 'taught', you’ll seek to learn. And only by your effort in learning a skill, a trade, a craft – and by employers being happy to pay you for your skills – will you and Makers Academy know you’ve succeeded. Success for us is you being able to achieve your personal objective and ours as a company: making you as employable as possible.

We charge fees when we place you in a company, so we're clearly highly incentivised to do everything we can to help you get a job. When you pay for the course, we cover our costs.But when we place you in a company, we become a profitable business, which we’ve set out to be. So unless you succeed, we don’t either. Your and our objectives are perfectly aligned.

But whether you paid us £8,000 or £8,000,000, you’d still have to do the work. We don't have a magic wand that can turn you into a developer.  Alongside having a positive attitude, hard work is the thing that will make the difference between success and failure.

And of course we can't guarantee you a job. None of us know what will happen during those 12 weeks. You might love software development or hate it. In the end, your chances of getting a job are based on how far you can take yourself in 12 weeks – so make the most of it. We'll be there to support you along the way, and as soon as you're ready, we'll set you up with the interviews you need. The rest will be up to you.

#### Transparency, Feedback and Improvement ####
The Makers Academy team has a policy of extreme transparency.

This isn't always pleasant, but it's absolutely effective. If we're talking about another staff member, they should be included in the conversation. If we have a concern about why something is done, it's our duty to bring it up and question it. Nobody is above being questioned. Nobody is too inexperienced or new to challenge anyone else on their reasoning or actions. In the most extreme case, someone who joined the team today has the right (and duty) to question Evgeny, the CEO and founder.

This explains why we want YOU to be transparent with us too. Most companies aren’t transparent and don't allow anyone in the company to question other people's actions. Traditional educational establishments don’t regularly ask for feedback, don't take action on the feedback they do receive, and fail to communicate it on the rare occasion when they have in fact read it.

But we do.

The entire team will read all of your written feedback and we regularly sit down with our students individually to talk face to face. Every Friday you can expect the head of education to write a report of the week’s feedback and what action could be taken. When we feel we can’t act on some feedback, we will explain the reasons why. But most importantly, we will trust that if you have any issues with the course, you'll know that it’s your responsibility to share it with us. It’s then up to us to listen to your views and come back to you with some answers.

On the same note, the placement team is open to your feedback, and no criticism will stop us from doing our utmost to place you in a job you love. In the past, some students have said that they were worried about giving feedback, for fear of making us not want to place them. This couldn't be further from the truth. We treasure your criticism, as it's one of the best ways for us to improve.

#### What do we expect from you? ####
These are a few characteristics that we look for in every student, including traits that our hiring partners have explicitly told us they look for.

#### Culturally ####
* Enthusiasm for  solving challenges and learning!
* Willingness to check in, connect, and share your  feelings
* Curiosity (how things fit in together and work)
* Exposing your ignorance. Speak up if you don’t know!
* You strike a good balance between listening and speaking
* Engage your peers, mentor or the coaches when you are stuck
* Taking ownership of your own journey, not expecting anyone else to lead you

#### Technically ####
* Identify concepts that are confusing and ask for help
* Demonstrate your comfort with reading and writing code
* Demonstrate your ability not just to write code, but to communicate about that code to others
* Use the technical skills you've learned in the challenges (or even in pet projects you might choose to do during the course).
* Transfer knowledge to other students in the course

#### Will I succeed? ####

#### You will be successful at Makers Academy and on the job market if you: ####
* Express your opinions and ideas
* Know when to speak and when to listen (communication is key)
* Seek out and create space for your fellow students' thoughts and opinions
* Are considerate of your fellow students
* Ask questions when you don’t understand something
* Discuss various options with your fellow students, as well as pros and cons
* Demonstrate your ability to research (_e.g. experimenting with methods in the interactive ruby environment - IRB, etc._)
* Let your fellow students know when you need thinking time instead of going silent
* Experiment with the code and cultivate a spirit of play
* Use the knowledge you’ve gained to solve the challenges
* HAVE FUN!

#### You will not be successful if you: ####
* Let your fellow students take over completely and “coast” through the sessions/course.
* Act like you understand something when you don’t
* Do not contribute to the code
* Do not ask questions
* Expect yourself to be perfect
* Expect your fellow students to be perfect
* Prioritise completion or speediness over understanding

#### Will you make it in the job market? ####
Making it in the job market isn't just about your technical skills, but you do need a minimum level of knowledge. By this we mean that you've completed all your Friday challenges and that the coaches, by looking at your code, feel you're ready to take on work and are willing to vouch for you.
But it's also about being a great person.

All employers tell us "we can teach them skills, but we can't teach them how to be an awesome team member". It's not just about learning to code, it's about learning to contribute incredible value to a development team, and ultimately to a company.

We're happy to give you feedback, but your future is in your hands. We're here to help and will do all we can to help you get a job, but it's mostly down to you, what you learn and the way you come across.

It takes an average of four to six weeks after Makers Academy to find a job, thanks to the nature of the hiring process in most companies. Make sure you have the necessary funds for at least that amount of time after the course, to ensure you're comfortable when applying for jobs (and during the course). If you're worried about money, you won't be in the best position to learn – which would be hugely unfair on yourself. Give yourself the best and most comfortable learning environment. You're here to learn for 12 weeks. Finding jobs can and will be done after the course ends.

#### What are we practically expecting from you? ####
* Be in our offices Monday to Friday from 09:00 to 18:00, at the very least.
* If you can't attend at any time, please tell us – don't just disappear
* Spend as much time coding as possible, including evenings and weekends
* Give us feedback frequently, both about what we're doing well and what we should be improving
* Push your code to Github, both for us to check and to build your portfolio
* Do not distract your peers, or disrupt their learning in any way
* Do not spend time thinking about a job or applying to jobs until the end of the course:instead, focus for 12 weeks on learning and nothing else.

#### What can you expect from us? ####
* An awesome space for the duration of the course, to immerse yourself in learning
* To be surrounded by other smart and dedicated students on the same mission
* Coaching support by professionals of all levels, to ensure you can learn in the most efficient way
* A flexibly structured curriculum to ensure you don’t waste time trying to find out what to learn
* We will listen to your feedback, communicate back to you and thrive to continuously improve what we do
* We will keep a critical and open mind about everything we do
* We will do everything we can to find you a suitable job
* We can't wait to see you turn your life upside down and learn a new craft.

Coding is hard and no one will find the course easy. It's not engineered to be easy, but engineered to get you to the right level to secure a job as a software developer.

Note that for a few people, 12 weeks isn't enough. We all have different abilities for learning specific skills. One may find learning to cook much easier than coding. But if it takes you more than 12 weeks, that's OK, we'll still be here to help you keep going.

**You will get to where you want to go, however long it takes.**
